# PX4 Swarm Controller

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

The aim of this repository is to provide a scalable multi-drone simulation for easy testing of control laws on fleets of
UAVs. The default controller is based on a leader-follower approach taken from the
paper [Distributed leader-follower formation control for
multiple quadrotors with weighted topology (Zhicheng Hou, Isabelle Fantoni)](https://hal.science/hal-01180491/document).

## Install

### ROS2

This package was written using ROS2 Humble under Ubuntu 22.04. If it's not installed, check
the [ROS2 documentation](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Alternatives/Ubuntu-Development-Setup.html) or run
the commands
below.

```shell
sudo apt update && sudo apt install locales
sudo locale-gen en_US en_US.UTF-8
sudo update-locale LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 LANG=en_US.UTF-8
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository universe
sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl -y
sudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key -o /usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release && echo $UBUNTU_CODENAME) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install ros-humble-desktop
sudo apt install ros-dev-tools
```

Don't forget to source your installation in the terminal or in your ```bashrc``` (See example below).

```shell
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
```

You will also need to have ```gazebo``` [installed](https://classic.gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=install_ubuntu).

### PX4 Autopilot

We used the PX4 Autopilot which uses the Micro XRCE-DDS Agent & Client as middleware.

Here are the installation commands to run in your terminal, you can also check
the [PX4 documentation](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/ros/ros2_comm.html):

```shell
cd
git clone https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot.git --recursive
bash ./PX4-Autopilot/Tools/setup/ubuntu.sh
cd PX4-Autopilot/
make px4_sitl

pip install --user -U empy==3.3.4 pyros-genmsg setuptools

git clone https://github.com/eProsima/Micro-XRCE-DDS-Agent.git
cd Micro-XRCE-DDS-Agent
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig /usr/local/lib/
```

### Install and build the package

- Create a ROS2 workspace (Skip if already done)
    ```shell
    cd
    mkdir -p ros2_ws/src
    ```
- Then clone this repository (ROS2 package) in ```ros2_ws/src``` and rename the directory as ```px4_swarm_controller```
  ```shell
  cd ros2_ws/src
  git clone https://github.com/artastier/PX4_Swarm_Controller.git
  mv PX4_Swarm_Controller px4_swarm_controller
  ```
- We need to ```overwrite``` the original ```sitl_multiple_run.sh```  of PX4 by the new one
  ```shell
  mv -i px4_swarm_controller/sitl_multiple_run.sh ~/PX4-Autopilot/Tools/simulation/gazebo-classic/sitl_multiple_run.sh
  ```
- Move the package containing the messages in the ```/src``` directory:
  ```shell
  mv px4_swarm_controller/custom_msgs/ ~/ros2_ws/src/
  ```
- Build the package and the custom messages using ```colcon```
  ```shell
  colcon build --packages-select custom_msgs
  colcon build --packages-select px4_swarm_controller
  ```
- Don't forget to source your ROS2 workspace in your terminal or in your ```bashrc``` (See example below).
  ```shell
  source ~/ros2_ws/install/local_setup.bash
  ```

Then you can run the simulation by launching ```lauch_simulation.py```:

```shell
ros2 launch px4_swarm_controller launch_simulation.py
```

## Usage

### Arming drones

To be able to switch to offboard mode (i.e Sending setpoints using ROS2 topics) the drone needs to
receive ```OffboardControlMode``` messages both <u>before</u> trying to <u>switch to offboard mode</u> and <u>arming</u>
the drone.

(See [ROS2 Offboard Control Example](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/ros/ros2_offboard_control.html#implementation))

The ```arming``` node aims to switch to offboard mode and arm all the drones in the simulation. Once it's done it will
shut down.

Given the ```number of drones``` as a parameter and **assuming** all the namespaces are standardized
with ```/px4_<instance_id>```, you can launch this node by adding the following code in your launch description:

```python
from launch_ros.actions import Node

Node(
    package='px4_swarm_controller',
    executable='arming',
    name='arming',
    namespace='simulation',
    parameters=[{"nb_drones": nb_drones}]
)
```

### Create your own control law

#### Neighbors message

You can create your custom ```Neighbors``` message for your custom command law. It should verify the traits specified in
the header ```NeighborsTraits```.

#### Neighborhood

You can handle the neighborhood of your drones by deriving from the class ```NearestNeighbors```. This class is
templated on the type of ```Neighbors``` message defined previously. You can then
override 3 methods:

- ```process_neighbor_position```

Executed when a drone has been detected as a neighbor from another drone.

- ```process_neighborhood```

Executed when the neighborhood of one drone has been computed

- ```enrich_neighborhood```

Executed when all neighborhood of all the drones have been computed.

If you want to see an example, check the ```WeightedTopologyNeighbors``` class.

#### Controller

You can build your controller based on the ```SwarmController``` interface which is templated on the
same ```Neighbors``` message than ```NearestNeighbors```.

You can override the ```neighbors_callback``` and the ```timer_callback``` which is quite explicit.

If you want to see an example, check the ```WeightedTopologyNeighbors``` class.

## Weighted Topology Swarm Controller

### Implementation

- We followed all the algorithms provided in the paper. However, the $\sigma_{n}$ operator wasn't specified but is
  defined
  as follows:

  $$\forall (a,b) \in \mathbb{R}^{2},\sigma_b(a) = sign(a)\times min(|a|,b)$$
- We have made a **small improvement** by adding a PID controller on the acceleration of each axis (XYZ).

  Indeed, in the paper, they were using proportional gains to weight the homogeneous term at a position and the
  homogeneous term at a velocity. The output of this weighted sum is an acceleration. Therefore, we directly applied a
  PID
  control on the acceleration command, and we **removed** the proportional gains.

  It allows us to apply this control on the Z-axis whereas in the paper, the drones where assumed in the same plan.

### Results

We tuned the PID controllers only for the swarm and the trajectories provided in this repository.

#### Circular trajectory

## Launchfile Configuration

You can change the characteristics of each node only by modifying the following configuration files.

### Swarm configuration

- **model**:
  ```"iris" "plane" "standard_vtol" "rover" "r1_rover" "typhoon_h480"```
- **initial_pose**: Initial coordinates in the North-East plane.
- **is_leader**: Defines if the drone is a leader or a follower for the swarm controller.
- **trajectory**: Provide the name of a YAML file defining waypoints in the ```config/Trajectorie``` directory.

```json
{
  "swarm": {
    "1": {
      "model": "iris",
      "initial_pose": {
        "x": 0.0,
        "y": 1.0
      },
      "is_leader": true
    },
    "2": {
      "model": "iris",
      "initial_pose": {
        "x": 1.0,
        "y": 0.0
      },
      "is_leader": false
    },
    "3": {
      "model": "iris",
      "initial_pose": {
        "x": 3.0,
        "y": 0.0
      },
      "is_leader": false
    }
  },
  "trajectory": "waypoints_up_and_down.yaml"
}
```

### Waypoints configuration

Waypoints are stored in the ```config/waypoints.yaml``` file.

They should be express in the **North-East-Down** frame. The ```waypoint``` node loops over the waypoints given for one
drone.

This node is launched if and only if the ```is_leader``` variable is set to ```true``` in the **Swarm
configuration file**. The key in the YAML file should correspond to the namespace of the drone you set
the ```is_leader``` variable to ```true``` (See example below).

You can also provide **2 thresholds**, the distance and the angle. When both the cartesian error and the angle error are
below these thresholds, the ```waypoint``` node sends the next setpoint.

```yaml
threshold: 0.1
threshold_angle: 0.4
# Coordinates are in the North east down frame x -> y and y -> x
wp:
  /px4_1:
    # Up and down
    - { x: 0, y: 1, z: -5, yaw: 0 }
    - { x: 0, y: 1, z: -1, yaw: 0 }
```

### Neighborhood and controller

- **neighbors_exe**: Name of the node executable that publish the neighborhoods of each drone.
- **neighbor_distance**: Distance under which a drone is considered as a neighbor.
- **x_formation**, **y_formation**, **z_formation**: Distance wanted between each follower and the leader in the North
  East Down convention.
- **controller_exe**: Controller node executable.
- **gains**: Gains for the 3 acceleration PID controllers of ```WeightedTopologyController```in this order:
  
  $$[K_{px},K_{ix},K_{dx},K_{py},K_{iy},K_{dy},K_{pz},K_{iz},K_{dz}]$$

```json
{
  "neighborhood": {
    "neighbors_exe": "weighted_topology_neighbors",
    "neighbor_distance": 3.0,
    "x_formation": [
      1.0,
      0.0,
      0.0
    ],
    "y_formation": [
      0.0,
      0.0,
      2.0
    ],
    "z_formation": [
      0.0,
      0.0,
      -1.0
    ]
  },
  "controller": {
    "controller_exe": "weighted_topology_controller",
    "gains": [
      1.0,
      0.0,
      0.0,
      2.5,
      0.0,
      0.0,
      2.75,
      0.1,
      0.001
    ]
  }
}

```
